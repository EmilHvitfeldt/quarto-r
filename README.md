## Overview

These workshops will prepare you to author a rich array of documents in Quarto, the next generation of R Markdown. Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that offers multilingual programming language support to create dynamic and static documents, books, presentations, blogs, and other online resources.

The focus of the introductory workshop will be on single documents. You will learn to create static documents, to add interactivity to them with Shiny and htmlwidgets, or steer them in the direction of sophisticated scientific documents. In the afternoon youâ€™ll take the same authoring approaches to create slide presentations in various formats such as reveal.js, beamer, and pptx.

The focus of the advanced workshop will be on projects that weave together multiple documents and allow you to write books and build websites. You will also learn various ways to deploy and publish your Quarto projects on the web.

## Prework

There is no need to install software or packages on your machine. All you'll need for the workshop is a laptop and a browser. We will set up RStudio environments for all participants on Posit Cloud that will have all of the software that you'll need.
